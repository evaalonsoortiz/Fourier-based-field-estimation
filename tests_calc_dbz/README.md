The folder **tests_calc_dbz** includes three scripts that have been used for testing and fixing the _dbz_calc_ method of FBFest, and to quantify the effect of different padding sizes on different phantoms. Some figures from the experiments are stored. These scipts have evolved a lot during successive experimentation and versions of the code and are thus less clean but can be useful to make further experiments.
